# Disentanglement with Beta VAE and Factor VAE

This project provides a PyTorch Lightning implementation for training and evaluating two popular models for learning disentangled representations: Î²-VAE and Factor-VAE. The goal is to explore how these models encourage the separation of underlying generative factors in data, using standard datasets like dSprites and MPI3D.
